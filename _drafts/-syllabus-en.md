### Caad4Rhino  Syllabus

**Program Overview**

This program is a 10 weeks program with a focus on computer-based architectural design and its automated production.  
Participants explore new techniques and methods for design that incorporate scripting and programming languages.   
Throughout the studies the participants expand their proficiencies in modeling, computer-based design. These skills augment their capabilities as architects by incorporating new fields of activities and they help to expand the definition of architecture as a whole.

**Program Structure**  
* Introduction of CAAD and Scripting
* Grasshopper & Parametric Design
* Rhino.python Developing

**Requirement**  
1. The student should have basic knowledge about Rhinoceros or some similar 3d modeling software.
2. During the course, there are three main assignments: 
    * grasshopper about free geometry
    * rhino.python algorilthm
    * final project.

**CAAD & Scripting Intro（one week)**  

**1st week**

CAAD

1. Generative Processes Programming-Object orientated programming in Java/Eclipse to generate three-dimensional nodal structures.
2. Digital Fabrication - Parametric design, CNC fabrication and construction.
3. Physical Computing-Sensing and controlling the physical world.

Scripting 

1.  Grasshopper, Designers look at design problems as a set of sophisticated relationships and to map those relationships graphically and programmatically into a system that allows them to interactively play with alternatives. 
2. Rhino.python
    * interactive scripts.
    * New custom commands.
    * Create new plug-ins.
    * Read and Write customized file formats.
    * Interact with cloud applications.
    * Create realtime links to other applications
    * Create customer Grasshopper components
    * Store and display project specific information beyond what basic Rhino can store.
3. .net & RhinoCommon
    * Rhinocommon is a low-level powerful SDK for all Rhino platforms used mainly by more experienced developers. 
    * Python scripts can use Rhinocommon, to have full access to the .NET framework including access to Rhino’s RhinoCommon SDK. 

4. Hello world
    * Your First Python Script in Rhino
